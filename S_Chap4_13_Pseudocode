Goal: finding all prime numbers between 1 and 100, using "Sieve of Eratosthenes" method
"Sieve of Eratosthenes" method works as follows: 

assume that all numbers are unmarked, start at 2 because 1 isn't a prime

we know that the first unmarked number 2 is a prime

eliminate all multiples of 2

go to the next unmarked number 3 -is a prime, eliminate all multiples of 3 starting with 9

next unmarked number is 5 is prime, eliminate all multiples of 5 starting with 25

7 is numarked so its prime, starting at 49 eliminate all multiples of 7

next is 11 but 11 square equals 121 which is >100, so all remaining unmarked numbers are prime
